### Where I'm from
ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· I was born and raised in a once quiet neighborhood on the west side of Istanbul. Towards the end of my 18th year I came to Germany for my university education, which I am still doing.

### What I do now
I am a Computer science and Media student at [Bauhaus University Weimar](https://www.uni-weimar.de/de/universitaet/start/) in Weimar.

My main goal is to combine computer science with social sciences.
